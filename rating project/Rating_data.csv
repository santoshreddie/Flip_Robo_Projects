4,5,"Beast Unleashed!!!Update - Battery backup tested at 60Hz. Screenshots attached for fool proof evidence.Those of you who said that battery drains faster than other phones you might not be knowing that the phone by default runs at 120Hz refresh rate which no other phone in the indian market offers, it makes your screen smoother than any other phone at the budget segment but it has a price to pay, the battery drains out. I would say the phone at 60hz isn't as fast as 120hz but it's faster than...READ MORE",Awesome

7,5,Sony IMX 686 sensor is really flagship level camera sensor. Captured pitch dark night sky with google camera night sight (Astrophotography) mode and got very impressive results which can easily beat a DSLR camera. The stars captured in image were so fade in reality that they were not even visible to naked eyes. Snapdragon 730G SOC is powerful enough to handle the most graphics intensive operations. Played few games capable of achieving 120 fps and they were easily handled by this processor....READ MORE,Simply awesome

561,5,Fabulous device. Very good looking and so attractive. The phone is not heavy as much says in reviews. Only felt it's not handy due to its 6.67 inch displayGot a decent full day battery backup with 120hz display refresh rate. I also used Realme 6 pro. Genuinely far better than Realme. It's 90hz not better and felt like as 60hz. Battery backup is also tied to Poco X2. For this price range better than Realme 6 pro in Performance and Design. Recommend to go for Poco X2 in this price rangeREAD MORE,Must buy!
562,3,"Its ok, not that good as told in the reviews, i am only feeling a minute difference in the120hz. May be the software is not optimized, there are lags when scrolling and all, so could not say much on 120hz. Camera is aggresive with the processing, if you zoom in, you can find the difference in the images, it looks as somebody painted on the image. Heating is there when doing aggresive tasks like gaming, yet to check it more to see whether it becomes unbearable.Charging is the only superfast th...READ MORE",Nice

The 2mp depth sensor has no role, it is just for show.Battery: the battery of poco X2 can last upto 10 hour with normal usage. But I use phone very frequently so I have to charge it twice a day. No doubt the 27 watt fast charge will charge your phone within an hour.120hz: if a phone has 120hz refresh rate then the ...READ MORE",Good quality product
565,5,Must Buy!The best phone under budget so far. Look wise it's so much similar to S10plus from the front. The punch hole display gives you the premium feels and the 6.67inch screen looks amazingly perfect.  The camera is superb  and captures all the detailed pictures. 64MP camera gives you the high quality photo which is of 30mb. Macro lens works well too but lags somewhere while focusing. The battery is pretty good when used in 60Hz but when used with 120Hz it uses more battery power. I...READ MORE,Highly recommended
566,5,"It's been doing fine so far.. Except for the low light photos which are not the best I'd say, the camera performs well in daylightPerfomance wise it's good but the redmi note 8 pro has a stronger processor. But the poco has an advantage of having a 120hz screen(which drains the battery too)Using it on 60hz will give you a good battery life but then, the whole point of buying this phone was for the 120hz display.

10802,5,Writing it after using it for more then one month. Picture quality is good but sound quality is ok. It is not clear on high volume. Lots of connectivity options are there and interface is quite easy to use. Google Voice works like a charm. Built-in Chromecast is there and works like a pro.

10806,4,Firstly let me get the bad out of the way. Sound is loud enough for an average room but not for a large living room or hall space. It also lacks bass. Now coming to the pros. Connectivity is good and everything. 1080p or 4k videos bring out the picture quality but understandably don't expect eye popping clarity on normal TV channels (non-HD). The best thing about it is the price-point. You possibly won't find any better options in this budget. Xiaomi service providers are always happy to help...READ MORE,Good choice

12093,1,"When the TV is turned on, why should it take such a long time to come to life? A maximum of 5 seconds is ok. Not 60 sec+. I found Vu TV too behaving the same way. The number of steps one has to go through to connect to Bluetooth earphones is too much. This is a frequently used option and should automatically get connected everytime both the TV and the (pre-paired) Bluetooth are on. Or at least (if it's a common TV for the entire family) quickly ask if Bluetooth speakers should get connected.READ MORE",Nice

24454,4,"Boat rockerz 355 battery is a far better than oneplus. The only reason I prefer one plus is due to magnetic connection that boat rockerz not providing.
